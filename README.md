# EasyBlockList
This is a script for Reassembly that you can run to generate a block list.
# Usage
Run the script and the script will guide you through all the steps required. You will need to have a lua compiler to run it.
# todo
Add a compiled version so that people can just run it as an executable for their OS.
# UNSTABLE
This is the development version, more commonly known as "Bleeding Edge." This is where all edits that I post that are potentially unstable will go before being finally pushed to the main branch. I will rarely use this branch myself, this is mostly used to test other pull requests.
